The project includes a phased series of planned and potential lane reconfigurations on select roadway segments to calm traffic and improve safety along the corridor. Lane conversions will impact roadway capacity along this principal arterial to accommodate enhanced bike facilities and in-lane bus stops. Some of the roadway segments to be rechannelized are confirmed, along NE 130th and Roosevelt Way NE, while others will be evaluated for potential inclusion through the design process (along NE 125th). Safety measures and multimodal enhancements are also being evaluated, e.g., new and improved transit stops and amenities, pedestrian crossing improvements, signal improvements, bicycle facilities, etc. The western portion of the corridor includes a new street design with protected bike lanes, sidewalk repairs, crossing upgrades, new accessible curb ramps, and new street trees. We are also supporting new bus service in the area with upgraded and relocated bus stops, a full street reconstruction for heavier bus and freight vehicles, and other bus priority

Central to Practical\r\nSolutions planning is a process that identifies regional and corridor performance, engages communities\r\nto ascertain local contexts and needs, and applies methods to evaluate and implement phased near-\r\nterm, mid-term, and long-term solutions. The Practical Solutions approach is to engage the community\r\nand local stakeholders at the earliest stages of scope definition to ensure their input is included at the right stage of the solution development process. The TAG and Executive Committee developed the\r\ncorridor vision, provided feedback on performance gaps to ensure the evaluation aligned with the\r\ncorridor vision, and provided local expertise to the review of study findings. The outcome of Practical\r\nSolutions planning is a recommended set of multimodal strategies that are cost-effective and balance\r\nthe goals and objectives of state and local needs.","location":"SR 16","endpoint_a":"SR 160 ","endpoint_b":"SR 3","milepost_a":"23.0","milepost_b":"29.2","county_id":"18","total_cost":"140205422.0","constant_dollar_year":"2022-01-01","funds_description":"","primary_improvement_type_id":null,"start_year":"2036-01-01","completion_year":"2040-01-01","functional_class":"12","change_in_project_scope":null,"prioritization_a1a":true,"prioritization_a1b":false,"prioritization_a2a":true,"prioritization_a2b":null,"prioritization_a3":false,"prioritization_a4":false,"prioritization_a4_continued":"","prioritization_f1":true,"prioritization_f2":false,"prioritization_f3":null,"prioritization_f4a":false,"prioritization_f4b":true,"prioritization_f5":true,"prioritization_f6":true,"prioritization_j1a":false,"prioritization_j1b":false,"prioritization_j2":false,"prioritization_j3":true,"prioritization_j4":null,"prioritization_m1":true,"prioritization_m2":false,"prioritization_m3":false,"prioritization_m4":false,"prioritization_m5":null,"prioritization_m6":null,"prioritization_m7":null,"prioritization_w1a":false,"prioritization_w1b":null,"prioritization_w1c":null,"prioritization_w1d":null,"prioritization_w2":true,"prioritization_w4a":false,"prioritization_w4b":true,"prioritization_s1a":false,"prioritization_s1b":true,"prioritization_s1c":false,"prioritization_s2":null,"prioritization_o1":null,"prioritization_o2a":false,"prioritization_o2b":false,"prioritization_o2c":false,"prioritization_o3a":false,"prioritization_o3b":false,"prioritization_o3c":false,"prioritization_c1a":false,"prioritization_c1b":false,"prioritization_c1c":true,"prioritization_c2a":false,"prioritization_c2b":false,"prioritization_c3":false,"prioritization_c4":null,"prioritization_c5":null,"prioritization_t1":true,"prioritization_t2":true,"prioritization_t3":true,"prioritization_t4":null,"change_sponsoring_agency":null,"change_title":null,"change_description":null,"change_location_information":null,"change_total_cost":null,"change_constant_dollar_year":null,"change_completion_year":null,"change_functional_class":null,"current_step":14,"funds_committed":"0.0","prepopulated":null,"change_start_year":null,"old_total_cost":null,"old_constant_dollar_year":null,"prioritization_m3a":null,"prioritization_m3b":null,"prioritization_m7a":null,"prioritization_m7b":null,"contact_2_first_name":"Kirsty","contact_2_last_name":"Montes","contact_2_email":"kirsten.montes@wsdot.wa.gov","contact_2_phone":"3607043278","modify_complete":null,"prioritization_w3":true,"updated_cost_explanation":"N/A","cosponsors":[],"mtp_improvement_types":[{"id":3,"number":"3","name":"Add or Remove General Purpose Capacity Lanes","category":"Roadway","position":3,"created_at":"2017-01-18T21:41:20.043-08:00","updated_at":"2017-01-18T21:41:20.043-08:00"},{"id":8,"number":"8","name":"Interchange Improvements","category":"Roadway","position":8,"created_at":"2017-01-18T21:41:20.097-08:00","updated_at":"2017-01-18T21:41:20.097-08:00"},{"id":33,"number":"33","name":"Intelligent Transportation System","category":"ITS","position":33,"created_at":"2017-01-18T21:41:20.322-08:00","updated_at":"2017-01-18T21:41:20.322-08:00"}]}},{"mtp_project":{"id":3138,"user_id":"WDTO","status":"completed","created_at":"2025-04-04 09:30:28 -0700","updated_at":"2025-04-04 09:33:36 -0700","submitted_at":null,"accepted_at":null,"new_project":false,"modify_from_unprogrammed_to_constrained":null,"modify_constrained_project_details":null,"project_id":5759,"sponsoring_agency_id":null,"title":"SR 410/254th Ave E to Cole St - Widening","contact_first_name":"Gaius","contact_last_name":"Sanoy","contact_email":"gaius.sanoy@wsdot.wa.gov","contact_phone":"3603572617","mtp_status":"NULL","description":"Widening and roundabouts.
